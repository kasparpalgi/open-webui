## Key Features of Open WebUI ⭐

- 🚀 **Effortless Setup**: Install seamlessly using Docker or Kubernetes (kubectl, kustomize or helm) for a hassle-free experience with support for both `:ollama` and `:cuda` tagged images.

- 🤝 **Ollama/OpenAI API Integration**: Effortlessly integrate OpenAI-compatible APIs for versatile conversations alongside Ollama models. Customize the OpenAI API URL to link with **LMStudio, GroqCloud, Mistral, OpenRouter, and more**.

- 🛡️ **Granular Permissions and User Groups**: By allowing administrators to create detailed user roles and permissions, we ensure a secure user environment. This granularity not only enhances security but also allows for customized user experiences, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility amongst users.

- 🔄 **SCIM 2.0 Support**: Enterprise-grade user and group provisioning through SCIM 2.0 protocol, enabling seamless integration with identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace for automated user lifecycle management.

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a seamless experience across Desktop PC, Laptop, and Mobile devices.

- 📱 **Progressive Web App (PWA) for Mobile**: Enjoy a native app-like experience on your mobile device with our PWA, providing offline access on localhost and a seamless user interface.

- ✒️🔢 **Full Markdown and LaTeX Support**: Elevate your LLM experience with comprehensive Markdown and LaTeX capabilities for enriched interaction.

- 🎤📹 **Hands-Free Voice/Video Call**: Experience seamless communication with integrated hands-free voice and video call features, allowing for a more dynamic and interactive chat environment.

- 🛠️ **Model Builder**: Easily create Ollama models via the Web UI. Create and add custom characters/agents, customize chat elements, and import models effortlessly through [Open WebUI Community](https://openwebui.com/) integration.

- 🐍 **Native Python Function Calling Tool**: Enhance your LLMs with built-in code editor support in the tools workspace. Bring Your Own Function (BYOF) by simply adding your pure Python functions, enabling seamless integration with LLMs.

- 📚 **Local RAG Integration**: Dive into the future of chat interactions with groundbreaking Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) support. This feature seamlessly integrates document interactions into your chat experience. You can load documents directly into the chat or add files to your document library, effortlessly accessing them using the `#` command before a query.

- 🔍 **Web Search for RAG**: Perform web searches using providers like `SearXNG`, `Google PSE`, `Brave Search`, `serpstack`, `serper`, `Serply`, `DuckDuckGo`, `TavilySearch`, `SearchApi` and `Bing` and inject the results directly into your chat experience.

- 🌐 **Web Browsing Capability**: Seamlessly integrate websites into your chat experience using the `#` command followed by a URL. This feature allows you to incorporate web content directly into your conversations, enhancing the richness and depth of your interactions.

- 🎨 **Image Generation Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate image generation capabilities using options such as AUTOMATIC1111 API or ComfyUI (local), and OpenAI's DALL-E (external), enriching your chat experience with dynamic visual content.

- ⚙️ **Many Models Conversations**: Effortlessly engage with various models simultaneously, harnessing their unique strengths for optimal responses. Enhance your experience by leveraging a diverse set of models in parallel.

- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure secure access with restricted permissions; only authorized individuals can access your Ollama, and exclusive model creation/pulling rights are reserved for administrators.

- 🌐🌍 **Multilingual Support**: Experience Open WebUI in your preferred language with our internationalization (i18n) support. Join us in expanding our supported languages! We're actively seeking contributors!

- 🧩 **Pipelines, Open WebUI Plugin Support**: Seamlessly integrate custom logic and Python libraries into Open WebUI using [Pipelines Plugin Framework](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines). Launch your Pipelines instance, set the OpenAI URL to the Pipelines URL, and explore endless possibilities. [Examples](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/tree/main/examples) include **Function Calling**, User **Rate Limiting** to control access, **Usage Monitoring** with tools like Langfuse, **Live Translation with LibreTranslate** for multilingual support, **Toxic Message Filtering** and much more.

- 🌟 **Continuous Updates**: We are committed to improving Open WebUI with regular updates, fixes, and new features.

## How to Install 🚀

### Installation via Python pip 🐍

Open WebUI can be installed using pip, the Python package installer. Before proceeding, ensure you're using **Python 3.11** to avoid compatibility issues.

1. **Install Open WebUI**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install Open WebUI:

   ```bash
   pip install open-webui
   ```

2. **Running Open WebUI**:
   After installation, you can start Open WebUI by executing:

   ```bash
   open-webui serve
   ```

This will start the Open WebUI server, which you can access at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Quick Start with Docker 🐳

> [!NOTE]  
> Please note that for certain Docker environments, additional configurations might be needed. If you encounter any connection issues, our detailed guide on [Open WebUI Documentation](https://docs.openwebui.com/) is ready to assist you.

> [!WARNING]
> When using Docker to install Open WebUI, make sure to include the `-v open-webui:/app/backend/data` in your Docker command. This step is crucial as it ensures your database is properly mounted and prevents any loss of data.

> [!TIP]  
> If you wish to utilize Open WebUI with Ollama included or CUDA acceleration, we recommend utilizing our official images tagged with either `:cuda` or `:ollama`. To enable CUDA, you must install the [Nvidia CUDA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/nvidia-container-runtime-upgrade/) on your Linux/WSL system.

### Installation with Default Configuration

- **If Ollama is on your computer**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **If Ollama is on a Different Server**, use this command:

  To connect to Ollama on another server, change the `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to the server's URL:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://example.com -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```

- **To run Open WebUI with Nvidia GPU support**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 --gpus all --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:cuda
  ```

### Installation for OpenAI API Usage Only

- **If you're only using OpenAI API**, use this command:

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 3000:8080 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_secret_key -v open-webui:/app/backend/data --name open-webui --restart always ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main
  ```
